## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```

/index.html
/styles.css
/assets/           # images, icons, etc.
README.md

````

- **index.html** â€“ Main landing page with sections like Welcome, Projects, About, and Contact  
- **styles.css** â€“ Styles and layout rules, includes a responsive media query for mobile  
- **assets/** â€“ Images and other media used in your portfolio

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- A **fixed navbar** (`id="navbar"`) linking to each section  
- A **full-height welcome section** (`id="welcome-section"`) with an `<h1>` greeting  
- A **projects section** (`id="projects"`) containing at least one `.project-tile`  
- Each project tile includes a clickable **external link** to a live project  
- A **profile link** (`id="profile-link"`) that opens your GitHub or freeCodeCamp profile in a new tab  
- Smooth scroll behavior and responsive styles via a **media query**  

---

## ðŸ“± Responsive Design

A responsive media query ensures the layout adapts gracefully on screens narrower than 600px:

```css
@media (max-width: 600px) {
  nav#navbar ul {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
  .project-tile {
    width: 90%;
  }
}
````

Replace or extend this as your style evolves.
